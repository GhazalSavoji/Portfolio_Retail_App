## Raw Data
Original Kaggle datasets (dataset1.csv, dataset2.csv). These are kept unchanged.

## Intermediate Data
CSV files generated from raw data after cleaning, splitting tables, and some transformations:
- users.csv
- devices.csv
- sessions.csv
- invoice_info.csv
- sales_info.csv
- event_types.csv

These files are ready to be imported into a SQL database for analysis.
Note that sample CSV files are uploaded in GitHub to prevent unauthorized use of the full dataset.
